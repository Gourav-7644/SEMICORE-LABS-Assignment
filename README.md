# Smart Parking & People Tracking AI System

This project implements two core systems for intelligent surveillance and infrastructure management as part of the Smart Parking & Surveillance AI Model Challenge:

1. Smart Parking Detection System**: Detects and tracks parking space occupancy using YOLOv8 and OpenCV with over 97% accuracy.
2. People Tracking System**: Detects and tracks individuals in video footage, assigning unique IDs using YOLOv8 and a custom tracking algorithm.

## Performance Metrics

### Smart Parking Detection
- Accuracy: 97.47%
- Precision: 92.42%
- Recall: 100.00%
- Processing Speed: 0.61 FPS
- Detection Basis: Center point within defined polygonal zones

### People Tracking System
- Tracking Stability: High consistency across frames
- ID Assignment: Accurate tracking with minimal ID switching
- Output: Cleanly annotated video with unique bounding boxes per person

## Setup & Usage

### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Smart Parking Detection
```bash
cd PARKING_DETECTION
python main.py
```

### People Tracking
```bash
cd PEOPLE_TRACKING
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Parking Detection System:
- Polygon coordinates for each slot hardcoded in `main.py`
- Object class filtered to `car`
- Center-point based slot validation

Tracking System:
- Object class filtered to `person`
- Tracker handles object continuity

## Performance Summary

### Parking Detection Results
- Accuracy: 97.47%
- Recall: 100.00%
- Precision: 92.42%
- FPS: ~0.6 on CPU

### People Tracking Results
- Consistent identity tracking with real-time feedback
- Minimal identity drift
- High detection reliability under varying lighting
